Data analysis:
    - trans:
        - Likely connection between at least a pair in ["type", "operation", "k_symbol"] parameters
            - Should check this connections not only for "trans_train" data but also "trans_test" to see if pattern maintains or if there are new patterns
                - No new patterns would allow for merge of these variables
        - Possible vars extracted from data:
            - income per month (avg)
            - expenses per month (avg)
            - total revenue per month (avg)
            - income in last X months - X needs to be defined 
                - This may not be that useful since even unemployed people can have income, but can be replaced by "revenue in last X months" which complements other vars
            - amount of credit introduced in each transaction (avg)
                - Would allow to see if the person has a steady income or if it is rocky
                - Might not be that useful, need to see if this var will amount to a significant data
                - This var can be changed to not be a simple avg but also relate it to the total income per month
    - loan:
        - Possible vars extracted from data:
            - amount / duration / payments
                - Check if relationships are a constant throughout the data
            - the variables extracted in this table can be further compared with data obtained from the "trans" data
    - card:
        - Identify meaning of each type:
            - data needs to be categorized
    - account:
        - Discover meaning issuance:
            - tax of credit transaction?
            - extract of information?
            - ?
    - client:
        - Extract gender from birth_number variable
            - birth_number format
                - Men: YYMMDD
                - Women: YY(MM+50)DD
    - disp:
        - Check meaning of "DISPONENT"
            - "only owner can issue permanent orders and ask for a loan"
                - Do DISPONENT clients have loans for these accounts?
    - district:
        - Possible vars extracted from data:
            - variance in:
                - unemployment rate 
                - crimes committed (in %)
        - Verify correlations between columns
            - Check if no. of municipalities relates to anything
